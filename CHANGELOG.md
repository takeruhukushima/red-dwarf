    individually, rather than using DataFrames.
  - Allow passing extra `coord_data` beyond what's labelled.
- Add automatic padding to polis implementation when cluster centroid guesses are provided.
- Add `PolisKMeans` scikit-learn estimator with:
  - cluster initialization strategy matching Polis,
  - new `init_centers` argument with more versatility for being given more/less guesses than needed, and
  - new instance variable `init_centers_used_` to allow inspection of guesses used.
- Allow passing KMeans `init` strategy into `find_optimal_k()`.
- Remove `pad_centroid_list_to_length` helper function.
- Add `GridSearchNonCV` to find optimal K via silhouette scores.
- For interal util functions, replace `max_group_count` args with `k_bounds` for upper and lower k bounds.
- Add `PolisKMeansDownsampler` transformer to support base clustering.
- Update `get_corrected_centroid_guesses()` to also extract from base clusters.
