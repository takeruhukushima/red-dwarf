# Changelog

## [Unreleased][] (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Fixes
- Allow `is_strict_moderation` to be inferred from not just API data, but file data.
- Better handle numpy divide-by-zero edge-cases in two-property test. ([#28](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf/pull/28))
- Fix bug where `vote_matrix` was modified directly, leading to subtle side-effects.

### Changes
- Fixed participant projections to map more closely to Polis with `utils.pca.sparsity_aware_project_ptpt()`.
- Add simple Polis implementation in `reddwarf.implementations.polis`.
- Add singular `polis_id` arg as recommended way to download (auto-detect `report_id` vs `converation_id`).
- Calculate group-aware consensus stats. ([#28](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf/pull/28))
- Removed `scale_projected_data()` in `PolisClient` (now happens in `run_pca()`).
- Deprecate `PolisClient()`.
- Add `inverse_transform()` to `SparsityAwareScaler`.
- Add data loader support for local math data files.
- Add support to easily flip signs in `generate_figure()`.
- Modify `generate_figure()` to accept more effective args.
    - Use numpy args of `coord_data`, `coord_labels` and `cluster_labels`
      individually, rather than using DataFrames.
    - Allow passing extra `coord_data` beyond what's labelled.
- Add automatic padding to polis implementation when cluster centroid guesses are provided.
- Add `PolisKMeans` scikit-learn estimator with:
    - cluster initialization strategy matching Polis,
    - new `init_centers` argument with more versatility for being given more/less guesses than needed, and
    - new instance variable `init_centers_used_` to allow inspection of guesses used.
- Allow passing KMeans `init` strategy into `find_optimal_k()`.
- Remove `pad_centroid_list_to_length` helper function.
- Add `GridSearchNonCV` to find optimal K via silhouette scores.
- For interal util functions, replace `max_group_count` args with `k_bounds` for upper and lower k bounds.
- Add `PolisKMeansDownsampler` transformer to support base clustering.
- Update `get_corrected_centroid_guesses()` to also extract from base clusters.
- Remove extraneous return values from `PolisClusteringResult`.
- Add `data_presenter.generate_figure_polis()` for making graphs from PolisClusteringResult.

### Chores
- Moved agora implementation from `reddwarf.agora` to `reddwarf.implementations.agora` (deprecation warning).
- Add missing `conversation.json` fixture file.
- Extract statement processing from polis class-based client to pure util function.
- Add types to fully describe polismath object. ([#28](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf/pull/28))
- Add new fixture for large convo without meta statements. ([#28](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf/pull/28))
- Add ability to filter unit tests and avoid running whole suite. ([#44](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf/pull/44))
- Improve test fixture to download remote Polis data.
- Add helper to support simple sign-flips in Polis test data.
- Remove usage of PolisClient in tests, in favour of [data] Loader.
- Start storing `keep_participant_ids` in fixtures.
- Add solid unit test for expected variance, which is stablest measure we can derive.
- Use dataclasses for `polis_convo_data` test fixture.
- Add `utils.polismath.get_corrected_centroid_guesses()` to initiate centroid guesses from Polis API.
- Remove unused `init_cluster()` helper.

## [0.2.0][] (2025-03-24)
### Fixed
- Relax seaborn version constraint to be compatible with TabPFN. ([#16](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf/issues/16))
- Data loader was not downloading last participant's votes, so most PCA results slightly off. ([#29](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf/issues/29))

### Changes
- Implement `utils.calculate_representativeness()` function. ([#22](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf/issues/22))
- Add color legend for labels in `data_presenter.generate_figure()`. [`d55f535`](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf/pull/24/commits/d55f53588de72620abb984d7c1ac27f8a31d5478) ([#22](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf/issues/22))
- Implement calculations of all comment statistics. ([#25](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf/pull/25))
- Implement `utils.select_representative_statements()` to reproduce polismath output. ([#25](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf/pull/25))
- Migrate from `red-dwarf-democracy` PyPI project namespace to `red-dwarf`.

### Chores
- Restructure `utils.py` into separate files. ([#26](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf/pull/26))
- Add unit tests for `utils.run_pca()` to test against real polismath data.
- Add unit tests for `agora.run_clustering()`.
- Parametrize unit tests for real polis convo data.
- Add testing for notebook examples. ([#34](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf/pull/34))

## [0.1.1][] (2025-03-04)
### Bugfixes

    - Workaround for [`pypa/setuptools#4769`](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4759).
- Change package name from `reddwarf` to `red-dwarf-democracy`.
